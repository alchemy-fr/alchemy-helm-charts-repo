### Upcoming Changes
Soon, we will be splitting this repository into two separate ones—one for Phraseanet and another for Phrasea—to better align with their development paths and to streamline updates and management.

## Configuration

Each chart includes a `values.yaml` file, which you can customize according to your needs. For detailed configuration options, it is recommended to review the specific documentation of each chart.
